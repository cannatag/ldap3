(E1)  text truncation (?)

Apparently, the text of the first paragraph of Section 3.2,
on page 18 of RFC 4512, has been truncated inadvertently.
The RFC text says:

   A subentry is a "special sort of entry, known by the Directory, used
   to hold information associated with a subtree or subtree refinement"
|  [X.501].  Subentries are used in Directory to hold for administrative
|  and operational purposes as defined in [X.501].  Their use in LDAP is
   detailed in [RFC3672].

I suspect that it should in fact say:

   A subentry is a "special sort of entry, known by the Directory, used
   to hold information associated with a subtree or subtree refinement"
|  [X.501].  Subentries are used in the Directory to hold attributes for
|  administrative and operational purposes as defined in [X.501].  Their
   use in LDAP is detailed in [RFC3672].


(E2)  typo

In Section 4.1.7.1, near the bottom of page 30, the explanation,

     FORM is specifies the name form associated with this DIT structure
         rule;

should say:

|    FORM specifies the name form associated with this DIT structure
         rule;


(E3)  typo

The first paragraph of Section 5.1, on page 36, says:

   An LDAP server SHALL provide information about itself and other
   information that is specific to each server.  This is represented as
   a group of attributes located in the root DSE, which is named with
|  the DN with zero RDNs (whose [RFC4514] representation is as the
   zero-length string).

It should say:

   information that is specific to each server.  This is represented as
   a group of attributes located in the root DSE, which is named with
|  the DN with zero RDNs (whose [RFC4514] representation is the zero-
   length string).


(E4)  word omission

The second paragraph of Section A.2.1, on page 49, says:

   The <descr> syntax was changed to disallow semicolon (U+003B)
   characters in order to appear to be consistent its natural language
   specification "descr is the syntactic representation of an object
   descriptor, which consists of letters and digits, starting with a
   letter".  In a related change, the statement "an AttributeDescription
   can be used as the value in a NAME part of an
   AttributeTypeDescription" was deleted.  RFC 2252 provided no
   specification of the semantics of attribute options appearing in NAME
   fields.

And these are my side notes for future consideration.
There are a couple of missing articles in the RFC text.
I have noted the following places:


(N1)

In Section 4.1.1, on page 24, the explanation,

   where:
     <numericoid> is object identifier assigned to this object class;
     [...]

should better say:

   where:
|    <numericoid> is the object identifier assigned to this object
         class;
     [...]


(N2)

In Section 4.1.2,

a) on page 25, the literally same correction as (N1) applies, and

b) the explanation:

     SYNTAX identifies value syntax by object identifier and may suggest
         a minimum upper bound;

should better say:

|    SYNTAX identifies the value syntax by its object identifier and may
         suggest a minimum upper bound;

c) Finally, on top of page 26, the paragraph,

   If SUP field is provided, the EQUALITY, ORDERING, and SUBSTRING
   fields, if not specified, take their value from the supertype.

should better say:

|  If the SUP field is provided, the EQUALITY, ORDERING, and SUBSTRING
   fields, if not specified, take their value from the supertype.


(N3)

In Section 4.1.3, on page 27, -- similarly to (N1) --
the explanation,

   where:
     <numericoid> is object identifier assigned to this matching rule;
     [...]

should better say:

   where:
     <numericoid> is the object identifier assigned to this matching
         rule;
     [...]


(N4)

In Section 4.1.7.2, on page 31, -- again like in (N1) --
the explanation,

   where:
     <numericoid> is object identifier that identifies this name form;
     [...]

should better say:

   where:
     <numericoid> is the object identifier that identifies this name
         form;
     [...]


(N5)

The final sentence of Section 4.2, i.e. the 3rd paragraph on page 33,
says:

   The following subsections provide attribute type definitions for each
   of schema definition attribute types.

It should say:

   The following subsections provide attribute type definitions for each
|  of the schema definition attribute types.

Section A.3 says:

The second paragraph of Section A.3, at the bottom of page 50, says:

   Section 5.1 of RFC 2256 provided the definition of the 'objectClass'
   attribute type.  This was integrated into Section 2.4.1 of this
   document.  The statement "One of the values is either 'top' or
   'alias'" was replaced with statement that one of the values is 'top'
   as entries belonging to 'alias' also belong to 'top'.

It should say:

   Section 5.1 of RFC 2256 provided the definition of the 'objectClass'
|  attribute type.  This was integrated into Section 3.3 of this
   document.  The statement "One of the values is either 'top' or
   'alias'" was replaced with statement that one of the values is 'top'
   as entries belonging to 'alias' also belong to 'top'.

Notes:

Apparently, 'Section 3.3' would have been much more appropriate than
'Section 2.4.1'.
