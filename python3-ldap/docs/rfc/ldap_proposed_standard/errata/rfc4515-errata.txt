Section 2 says:

The ASN.1 term, `AttributeValue`, has been replaced by
`AssertionValue` wherever it was used previously.
Hence, in Section 2 (on page 3) of RFC 4515

- the ASN.1 line

        AttributeValue ::= OCTET STRING

  is not needed any more and might have been omitted, and

- in the subsequent explanation, the sentence,

        [...]  The AttributeValue and AssertionValue OCTET STRING have
   the form defined in [RFC4517].  [...]

  might have been shortened to say:

        [...]  The AssertionValue OCTET STRING has the form defined ib
   [RFC4517].  [...]
