Throughout the document, when it says:

Example 3: A file containing a base-64-encoded value

Notes:

There is no section numbering in this RFC, hence the "GLOBAL".

Note 10 in "Notes on LDIF Syntax" says that base64-encoded values are subject to the same folding rules explained in Note 2. Note 2 requires folded lines to begin with a space character.

This modification was introduced passing from draft-good-ldap-ldif to RFC 2849.

Section Note 4 says:

Any dn or rdn that contains characters other than those
defined as "SAFE-UTF8-CHAR", or begins with a character other
than those defined as "SAFE-INIT-UTF8-CHAR",

It should say:

Any dn or rdn that contains characters other than those
defined as "SAFE-CHAR", or begins with a character other
than those defined as "SAFE-INIT-CHAR",

Notes:

This appears in note 4 of "Notes on LDIF Syntax".

---- Verifier notes ----
Note 4 has double text, one of which allows more than the other. But the ABNF
doesn't have that ambiguity. This is really something that can only be fixed by
revising the spec. It's simply not clear what the intent was.
